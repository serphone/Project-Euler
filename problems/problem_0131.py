    There are some prime values, p, for which there exists a positive integer,
    n, such that the expression n3 + n2p is a perfect cube. For example, when p
    = 19, 83 + 82Ã—19 = 123. What is perhaps most surprising is that for each
    prime with this property the value of n is unique, and there are only four
    such primes below one-hundred. How many primes below one million have this
    remarkable property?
