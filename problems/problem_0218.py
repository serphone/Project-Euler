    Consider the right angled triangle with sides a=7, b=24 and c=25. The area
    of this triangle is 84, which is divisible by the perfect numbers 6 and 28.
    Moreover it is a primitive right angled triangle as gcd(a,b)=1 and
    gcd(b,c)=1. Also c is a perfect square. We will call a right angled triangle
    perfect if -it is a primitive right angled triangle -its hypotenuse is a
    perfect square We will call a right angled triangle super-perfect if -it is
    a perfect right angled triangle and -its area is a multiple of the perfect
    numbers 6 and 28.  How many perfect right-angled triangles with câ‰¤1016 exist
    that are not super-perfect?
