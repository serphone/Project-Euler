    The primes 3, 7, 109, and 673, are quite remarkable. By taking any two
    primes and concatenating them in any order the result will always be prime.
    For example, taking 7 and 109, both 7109 and 1097 are prime. The sum of
    these four primes, 792, represents the lowest sum for a set of four primes
    with this property. Find the lowest sum for a set of five primes for which
    any two primes concatenate to produce another prime.
