    Consider graphs built with the units A:  and B: , where the units are glued
    along the vertical edges as in the graph . A configuration of type (a,b,c)
    is a graph thus built of a units A and b units B, where the graph's vertices
    are coloured using up to c colours, so that no two adjacent vertices have
    the same colour. The compound graph above is an example of a configuration
    of type (2,2,6), in fact of type (2,2,c) for all c â‰¥ 4. Let N(a,b,c) be the
    number of configurations of type (a,b,c). For example, N(1,0,3) = 24,
    N(0,2,4) = 92928 and N(2,2,3) = 20736. Find the last 8 digits of
    N(25,75,1984).
