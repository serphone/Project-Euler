    5-smooth numbers are numbers whose largest prime factor doesn't exceed 5.
    5-smooth numbers are also called Hamming numbers. Let S(L) be the sum of the
    numbers n not exceeding L such that Euler's totient function Ï†(n) is a
    Hamming number. S(100)=3728.   Find S(1012). Give your answer modulo 232.
